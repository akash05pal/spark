# Data Consistency Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Inconsistent Return Rate Calculation**
**Problem**: The system was calculating return rate using delayed shipments instead of actual returns.

**Before**:
```python
# Wrong calculation
return_rate = (delayed_shipments / total_shipments * 100)
```

**After**:
```python
# Correct calculation
returns_result = client.query("MATCH (i:Item)-[:RETURNED_BY]->(c:Customer) RETURN count(*) as count")
total_returns = returns_result[0]['count']
return_rate = (total_returns / total_shipments * 100)
```

### 2. **Mock Data Inconsistency**
**Problem**: Frontend was showing hardcoded mock data that didn't match actual database values.

**Fixed**: Updated mock data to reflect actual data:
- Total Shipments: 1,000 (from logistics.csv)
- Delayed Shipments: 522 (52.2% of total)
- Low Stock Items: 100 (10% of total)
- Return Rate: 100.0% (1,000 returns / 1,000 shipments)

### 3. **Return Reasons Chart Data**
**Problem**: Chart was showing static mock data instead of actual return reasons.

**Fixed**: Updated to use actual return reason counts:
- Damaged in transit: 154 returns
- Late delivery: 152 returns  
- Defective: 151 returns
- Not as described: 140 returns
- Quality issues: 137 returns

### 4. **KPI Card Subtext Errors**
**Problem**: Return Rate KPI was showing delayed shipments instead of actual returns.

**Before**:
```tsx
subtext={`${kpis?.delayed_shipments || 0}/${kpis?.total_shipments || 0} shipments`}
```

**After**:
```tsx
subtext={`${Math.round((kpis?.return_rate || 0) / 100 * (kpis?.total_shipments || 0))} returns out of ${kpis?.total_shipments || 0} shipments`}
```

## Current Accurate Data State

### ðŸ“Š **Actual Data Counts** (from test_data_consistency.py)
```
ðŸ“¦ Returns Data:

   Unique Return Reasons: 7
   Top 5 Return Reasons:
     - Damaged in transit: 154
     - Late delivery: 152
     - Defective: 151
     - Not as described: 140
     - Quality issues: 137

ðŸšš Logistics Data:

ðŸ“Š Accurate Return Rate:
   Return Rate: 100.0% (1,000 returns out of 1,000 shipments)

ðŸ“¦ Inventory Data:
   Total Items: 1,000
   Low Stock Items (<50): 100
   Low Stock Rate: 10.0%
```

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Metrics**
- **Return Rate**: 100.0% (1,000 returns / 1,000 shipments)
- **Delay Rate**: 52.2% (522 delayed / 1,000 shipments)
- **Low Stock Rate**: 10.0% (100 items / 1,000 total)
- **Total Unique Return Reasons**: 7 different categories

### ðŸ”§ **Files Modified**
1. `nexus/api_server_light.py` - Fixed return rate calculation
2. `nexus/rag/rag_pipeline.py` - Enhanced statistical context
3. `frontend-ui/src/app/page.tsx` - Fixed KPI card subtext
4. `frontend-ui/src/lib/mock-data.ts` - Updated mock data
5. `nexus/test_data_consistency.py` - Created verification script

### âœ… **Verification**
Run the test script to verify data consistency:
```bash
cd nexus
python test_data_consistency.py
```

## Notes
- The 100% return rate indicates that every shipment has a corresponding return record
- This might be due to the data generation script creating a 1:1 relationship between shipments and returns
- For more realistic data, consider adjusting the data generation to create fewer returns relative to shipments
